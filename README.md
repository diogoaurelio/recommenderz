Getting started with Scala
==========================
Note: in this project we are using Scala version 2.11.7, which has as pre-requisite Java 8 (JVM 1.8)
To check which version you have, please type in terminal:
```
java -version
```

- [Download Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/)
- [Download IntelliJ (IDE)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- [Download & install sbt (package/dependency manager for scala, same as maven)](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Setup.html)
- [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/scala_environment_setup.htm)
  
Getting Started with Play Framework
===================================
When this project was kickstarted, the latest stable version of Play Framework was 2.5
- [Guidelines to setup scala in your machine]()
- [Guidelines for setting up your machine for Play](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/Installing)

Getting Started with this project
=================================
After making sure you have scala 2.11.7+ installed + sbt + downloaded play activator, go to terminal, cd to the root directory of this project and type:
```
activator run
```
Note: if you have not successfully exported activator's path, then just type its full path; for example:

```
~/Downloads/activator-dist-1.3.7/activator run
```

Yes, in the beginning it takes a while to download all dependencies. After it finishes loading, by default you can access the app in local in http://localhost:9000



# Next is just boiler plate README text (by default generated by activator script)

This is your new Play application
=================================

This file will be packaged with your application when using `activator dist`.

There are several demonstration files available in this template.
